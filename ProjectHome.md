This Project is a summary of all necessary files to communicate the Arduino board with the supervisory and control software Elipse SCADA(http://www.elipse.com.br/port/download_scada.aspx) or open source supervisory program ScadaBR(http://www.scadabr.com.br/).

It was tested in Arduino MEGA1280 and Arduino UNO connected via USB port(the protocol used was Modbus RTU - RS232). Nevertheless, it should work with any arduino board,paying attention to the input/output pins adresses.

Please check downloads tab for the files and instructions.

Any information or suggestion you have please contact via email.
